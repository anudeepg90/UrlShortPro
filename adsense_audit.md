# Google AdSense Readiness Audit Plan for TinyYourl.com

This document contains all the **checks and investigations** that must be done on the site to determine why Google AdSense keeps rejecting it and to **improve eligibility**.  
Cursor (or any AI agent with full project access) should follow these steps to audit the site.

---

## 1. Check Site Content and Structure

**Goal:** Verify that the site has enough human-readable content and mandatory pages.

### ✅ Tasks:
1. Count the total number of **unique, readable words** on the homepage.
   - Minimum recommended: **800–1,000 words**.
   - Exclude boilerplate like buttons, placeholders, or repeated labels.
2. List all **pages** (routes) available to the public:
   - Check for `/`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`, `/about`, `/dmca` (report abuse).
3. Verify that **Privacy Policy** and **Terms & Conditions** pages exist and have at least 300+ words each.
4. Verify that there is **Contact Information**:
   - Email link or working form.
   - Ensure it is visible without login.
5. Confirm that **About Us** or **Mission page** exists.

**If any are missing, mark them as REQUIRED FIXES.**

## 2. Technical SEO and Crawlability

**Goal:** Ensure Googlebot can fully see and index the content.

### ✅ Tasks:
1. Verify **robots.txt**:
   - Located at `https://tinyyourl.com/robots.txt`.
   - Ensure it does not block `/` or important pages.
2. Verify **sitemap.xml**:
   - Located at `https://tinyyourl.com/sitemap.xml`.
   - Ensure all key pages are listed.
3. Check for **meta tags**:
   - `<title>`: Must be descriptive and unique.
   - `<meta name="description">`: 140–160 characters.
   - `<meta name="robots">`: Should not contain `noindex` for the homepage.
4. Simulate **Googlebot rendering**:
   - Output the fully rendered HTML of `/`.
   - Confirm that main content is visible in the **initial HTML**, not just after JS execution.
5. Check if all **sections and pages** are **link-accessible without login**.

## 3. Performance & Mobile Friendliness

**Goal:** Google favors fast and mobile-optimized sites.

### ✅ Tasks:
1. Measure **Lighthouse / PageSpeed** score for:
   - Mobile performance
   - Desktop performance
2. Confirm site is **mobile responsive**:
   - Check viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`.
   - Verify that primary features and sections render correctly on small screens.
3. Detect **console errors** or network failures:
   - Log any JS errors or 404 resources.

## 4. Ads.txt & AdSense Prerequisites

**Goal:** Ensure site technically meets AdSense file requirements.

### ✅ Tasks:
1. Verify that an **ads.txt file** exists at `https://tinyyourl.com/ads.txt`.
   - Even an empty placeholder is better than missing.
2. Verify **HTTPS** certificate is active and not expired.
3. Check if `<head>` contains:
   - `<title>` and `<meta description>`
   - **No meta noindex/nofollow**
4. Verify that Google Analytics or Search Console **tracking scripts** exist (optional but helps approval).

---

## 5. Traffic & Indexing Signals

**Goal:** Ensure site is not considered “inactive” or “empty.”

### ✅ Tasks:
1. Check if the site is **indexed in Google**:
   - Search: `site:tinyyourl.com`  
   - If no pages appear → major problem.
2. If using analytics, confirm **daily visits > 5** (even minimal).
3. Ensure the **main URL shortener function** works for logged-out users to prove usability.

---

## 6. Content Enhancement Recommendations

If the audit finds that the site is still “thin,” Cursor should generate suggestions like:
- Add a **How It Works** page (step-by-step explanation)
- Add **FAQ** with 5–7 real questions
- Add **Blog/Resources** (3–5 articles about link management, SEO, security)
- Add **DMCA / Report Abuse** page for UGC compliance

---

## ✅ Final Output

Cursor should produce:

1. **adsense_audit_report.md** including:
   - Missing pages and low-content warnings
   - Any blocked indexing or noindex flags
   - JS or rendering issues that prevent Googlebot from seeing content
   - Performance and mobile-friendliness scores
2. **Recommended Fixes** section with prioritized items
3. **Ready to Reapply** checklist

After these steps, you can safely reapply for Google AdSense.
